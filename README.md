# RockAndMinePrediction

This project involves a machine learning model that classifies sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The model is trained on the "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset, using various preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to achieve optimal performance. Key libraries used include numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
